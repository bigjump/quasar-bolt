For all designs I ask you to make, have them be beautiful, not cookie cutter. Make webpages that are fully featured and worthy for production.

By default, this template supports Vue3 composition API with script setup and Vite. It should use the built in Quasar css utility classes rather than Tailwind CSS etc. Do not install other packages for UI themes, icons, etc unless absolutely necessary or I request them.

Use icons from material-symbols for logos.

Use stock photos from unsplash where appropriate, only valid URLs you know exist. Do not download the images, only link to them in image tags.
